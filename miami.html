    <p id="hackSummary">At ShellHacks 2024, my team and I built Prospera, a financial wellness platform aimed 
        at supporting immigrant families as they navigate their financial journey. We were proud to take First 
        Place for the Vanguard challenge with a project that blended technology with human-centered design.
    </p>
    <p id="hackSummary2">Our goal was to create a financial tool that felt welcoming rather than intimidating.
         A key feature of Prospera is Foxy, a friendly avatar that reflects a user’s financial habits and 
         progress. Instead of displaying complex statistics, Foxy visually evolves as users make positive 
         financial decisions. This design helps users feel motivated and recognized without the pressure of 
         deciphering dense data.
    </p>
    <p id="hackSummary3">We developed Prospera using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, and integrated OpenAI’s 
     API to deliver personalized financial guidance. From the beginning, our focus was on empathy, building
     something that acknowledges the challenges immigrant families face and responds with clarity and 
     encouragement.
