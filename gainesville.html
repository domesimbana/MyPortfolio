        When I first arrived at the University of Florida, I knew I wanted to make the most of every opportunity that came my way, not just academically, but by becoming part of something bigger than myself. Over the past few semesters, I’ve been lucky to work on projects, lead initiatives, and collaborate with communities that have pushed me to grow as a computer engineer, problem solver, and person.

        One of my most rewarding experiences has been being part of SwampHacks, UF’s largest hackathon. I started out as the Marketing Director, where I designed graphics and built connections with student organizations and other hackathons. That experience taught me how to engage with a diverse audience and promote inclusion in tech. Now, heading into my senior year, I’m excited to step into a new role as Executive Finance Director, where I’ll help shape the future of the event by building relationships with sponsors and ensuring that SwampHacks has the resources to grow and thrive.

        As a sophomore, I participated in WingHacks, a hackathon focused on mentorship and representation in STEM. My team built WingCity, a Unity-based game using the OpenAI API that helped underrepresented students connect with potential mentors. It wasn’t just about coding, it was about building tools that uplift others. This year, I had the honor of returning to WingHacks as a mentor, supporting new teams and giving back to the same community that inspired me early in my journey. Seeing how much the next wave of hackers has to offer reminded me of how important it is to create space for growth and support.
        Through the SHPE Design Team, I also had the opportunity to apply my engineering skills in a real-world challenge. My team developed an autonomous vehicle using a Raspberry Pi, integrating sensors and writing control algorithms to navigate obstacles on its own. It was a hands-on project that sharpened both my technical and teamwork abilities and showed me the power of building with purpose.
        Each of these experiences has shown me how powerful community and curiosity can be. Whether it’s through building inclusive tech, designing with intention, or mentoring others, I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished and I’m even more excited for what’s ahead.
